#' Zseq : Integer Sequence Generator
#'
#' The world of integer sequence has long history, which has been accumulated in \href{The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences}{OEIS}.
#' Even though \code{R} is not a first pick for many number theorists, we introduce our package to enrich the \code{R} ecosystem as well as
#' provide pedagogical toolset. We adopted \pkg{Rmpfr} for flexible large number computations in that users can easily experience
#' large number sequences on a non-exclusive generic computing platform.
